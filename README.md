Implementations of the Ising model on ferromagnets

The plot below displayes the change in magnetisation and energy levels of a 2-D array representing a ferromagnet with increasing temperature.

The image plot below displays the change in spin configuration of each microstate in the 2-D array with increasing temperature. As temperature increases the ration of negatice and positive spins even out, decreasing the overall magnetic field around the ferromagnet.
